Whois

Info

Whois is a name for a TCP service, a tool, and a type of database. 
Whois databases contain name server, registrar, and, in some cases, full contact information about a domain name. 
Each registrar must maintain a Whois database containing all contact information for the domains they host. 
A central registry Whois database is maintained by the InterNIC24. 
These databases are usually published by a Whois server over TCP port 43 and are accessible using the whois client program.
