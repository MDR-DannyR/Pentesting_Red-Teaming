Port Scanning

Info 

Port scanning is the process of checking for open TCP or UDP ports on a remote machine

TCP

CONNECT scan - the full 3 way handshake
Stealth/Syn Scan - Syn / Syn-Ack. No Final Ack

UDP

Empty UDP packet is sent to the port. If port open, no reply sent from target machine. If port closed, ICMP port unreachable packet should be sent back from target machine. 

Unreliable as firewalls and router may drop ICMP packets - Could lead to false positives. 

Commands
