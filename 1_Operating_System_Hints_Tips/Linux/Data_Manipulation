Data Manipulation
 
To search for instances of 'september' in a file use grep: 

root@kali:~# grep September file

To only get certain parts of the results you can pipe the result into cut:
Note: -d specifies the delimiter as " " and f -f specifies only to take the 2nd field. 

root@kali:~# grep September file | cut -d " " -f 2



To Search and Replace a word in a file use sed: 

root@kali:~# sed 's/OriginalWord/New Word/' file

Note: the backslash is the delimiter in sed



To print only the entries where the first field is more than 5 use awk: 

root@kali:~# awk '$1 >5' file



To print only the first and third fields in a file use:

root@kali:~# awk '{print $1,$3;}' file
