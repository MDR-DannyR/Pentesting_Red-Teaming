Intro
 Penetration testing, or pentesting, involves simulating real attacks to assess the risk associated with potential security breaches. 

On a pentest (as opposed to a vulnerability assessment), the testers not only discover vulnerabilities that could be used by attackers but also exploit vulnerabilities, where possible, to assess what attackers might gain after a successful exploitation.

The stages of a penetration test are as follows:


Pre-Engagement Phase
Information Gathering Phase 
Threat Modelling 
Vulnerability Analysis
Exploitation 
Post-Exploitation 
Reporting

Pre-Engagement Phase
 		  			 
Understand your client’s business goals for the pentest. 
Ask questions about your client’s business - What matters most to them? 

Scope:

What IP addresses or hosts are in scope, and what is not in scope? 
What sorts of actions will the client allow you to perform? 
The testing window - are there specific hours or certain days not allowed?

Contact information:

Whom should you contact if you find something serious? 
Does the client expect you to contact someone 24 hours a day? 
Do they prefer that you use encryption for email?

A “get out of jail free” card:

Make sure you have authorization to perform a penetration test on the target. 
If a target is not owned by the company (for instance, because it’s hosted by a third party), make sure to verify that the client has formal approval from the third party to perform the penetration test. Regardless, make sure your contract includes a statement that limits your liability in case something unexpected happens, and get written permission to perform the test.

Payment terms
How and when will you be paid, and how much?

Include a nondisclosure agreement clause in your contract. 
Information Gathering
 The pentester searches for publicly available information about the client and identifies potential ways to connect to its systems.

Analyze freely available sources of information, a process known as gathering open source intelligence (OSINT). 

Use tools such as port scanners to get an idea of what systems are out there on the Internet or internal network as well as what software is running.
Threat Modelling
 The tester uses their insights from the information gathering stage to determine the value of each finding and the impact to the client if the finding permitted an attacker to break into a system. This evaluation allows the pentester to develop an action plan and methods of attack.
Vulnerability Analysis
 Actively discover vulnerabilities to determine how successful an exploit strategies may be. 

Run vulnerability scanners, which use vulnerability databases and a series of active checks to make a best guess about which vulnerabilities are present on a client’s system - perform manual analysis and verify results

Exploitation
 Run exploits against the vulnerabilities we’ve discovered

Post Exploitation
 Gather information about the attacked sys- tem, look for interesting files, attempt to elevate our privileges where neces- sary, and so on

Reporting
 Convey our findings to the customer in a meaningful way.

Executive Summary

	The executive summary describes the goals of the test and offers a high- level overview of the findings. The intended audience is the executives in charge of the security program. Your executive summary should include the following:

	Background 

	A description of the purpose of the test and definitions of any terms that may be unfamiliar to executives, such as vulnerability and countermeasure.

	Overall posture 

	An overview of the effectiveness of the test, the issues found (such as exploiting the MS08-067 Microsoft vulnerability), and general issues that cause vulnerabilities, such as a lack of patch management.

	Risk profile 

	An overall rank of the organization’s security posture compared to similar organizations with measures such as high, moder- ate, or low. You should also include an explanation of the ranking.

	General findings 

	A general synopsis of the issues identified along with statistics and metrics on the effectiveness of any countermeasures deployed.

	Recommendation summary 

	A high-level overview of the tasks required to remediate the issues discovered in the pentest.

	Strategic road map 

	Give the client short- and long-term goals to improve their security posture. For example, you might tell them to apply certain patches now to address short-term concerns, but without a long-term plan for patch management, the client will be in the same position after new patches have been released.

Technical Report

	This section of the report offers technical details of the test. It should include the following:

	Introduction 

	An inventory of details such as scope, contacts, and so on. Information gathering Details of the findings in the information-gathering phase. Of particular interest is the client’s Internet footprint.

	Vulnerability assessment 

	Details of the findings of the vulnerability analysis phase of the test.

	Exploitation/vulnerability verification 

	Details of the findings from the exploitation phase of the test.

	Post exploitation 

	Details of the findings of the post-exploitation phase of the test.

	Risk/exposure 

	A quantitative description of the risk discovered. This section estimates the loss if the identified vulnerabilities were exploited by an attacker.

	Conclusion
