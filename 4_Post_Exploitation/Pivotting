Pivoting
 
Add a route in metasploit 

msf > route add [network] [subnet mask] [session id]


If you don't want to use metasploit attacks:

set up a proxy server:
msf > use auxiliary/server/socks4a

edit the configuration file for ProxyChains at /etc/ proxychains.conf.

 socks4  127.0.0.1 [port number set previously]

 (note: these will now go through pivot)
