HTTP Tunneling

Info: 
Technique whereby a payload is encapsulated within the HTTP protocol. 
Usually this is done as the body of a HTTP GET or POST request. 

When behind an HTTP proxy server, the CONNECT HTTP method (a variation of HTTP tunneling) can be used by the client to ask the proxy server to forward a TCP connection to a specific destination. 
The proxy then makes the connection on behalf of the client. 
Once the connection with the server is established, the proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client 

From Client Machine

Connect to the proxy server on port 8888: 

root@kali:~# nc -vvn 192.168.1.130 8888 # 

Response from the proxy server: 

(UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.130] 8888 (?) open  # 

CONNECT HTTP method. Asking the proxy server to forward a TCP connection to the destination: 

CONNECT 10.11.1.203:80 HTTP/1.0 # 

Porxy Server Response Connecion established:

HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established 
Proxy-agent: tinyproxy/1.8.3

Command to send through the proxy server and through the TCP connection that was established

HEAD / HTTP/1.0 

Response from destination and through the proxy:
