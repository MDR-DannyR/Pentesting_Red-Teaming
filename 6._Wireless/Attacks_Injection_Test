# Attacks

## Injection Test 

The injection test determines if the wireless card can succesfully inject wireless packets and it measures the ping response time to access points. 
If you have two wireless cards connected, the test can determine which specific injection attacks can be succesfully executed. 

The basic injection test lists the access points in the area that respond to broadcast probes. For each access point found, it performs a 30 packet test to measyre the connection quality. The connection quality quantifies the ability of the card to succesfully send and revieve a response to the test target. 

### Usage 

Make sure airmon-ng is running prior to the test with the correct channel set. 
``` 
airmon-ng start wlan0 3
```

Run the test
```
aireplay-ng -9 -e <ESSID> -a <AP MAC> -i <interface> <interface name>
```

Where the options descriptions are as follows: 

```
-9: injection test
-e: optional ESSID (network name)
-a: optional AP MAC address
-i: optional interface name for the two card injection test
<interface name>: the interface name to use for the test
```
