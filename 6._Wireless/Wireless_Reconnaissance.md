# Alternatives to airodump-ng for wireless recon 

## Airgraph-ng 

Creates graphs of wireless networks using the CSV files generated by airodump-ng. 
The CSV files contain relationships between the wireless clients and the AP which can be passed to airgraph to produce two types of graphs: 

- Clients to AP relationship (CAPR)
- Clients Probe Graph (CPG)

### CAPR

displays the relationships between the clients and access points. Any APs with no clients connected will not be drawn. 
Colours are used to indicate type of encryption used: 

- Green: WPA 
- Yellow: WEP
- Red: Open
- Black: Unknown

```
airgraph-ng -i <csv filename> -g CAPR -o <output filename>
```

### CPG

Displays the relationships between wireless clients and probed networks. 

```
airgraph-ng -i <csv filename> -g CPG -o <output filename>
```

## Kismet

similiar to airodump-ng. 

detects networks, sniffs and can be an intrusion detection system. 

### GISKismet

can take data gathered from kismet coupled with a GPS reciever and generate Google Earth compatible KML files. (Need to have Kismet capture with GPS data included in it)
