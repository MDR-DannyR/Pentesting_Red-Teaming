Program: rinetd

Set up

root@kali:~# apt-get install rinetd 
root@kali:~# cat /etc/rinetd.conf

...
# bindadress bindport connectaddress connectport
...

Note: 

bindaddress = address that the traffic will be sent to 
bindport = port that the traffic will be sent to 
connectaddress = address that the traffic will be sent to 
connectport = port that the traffic will be sent to

Run: 

root@kali:~# /etc/init.d/rinetd restart


Usage

Situation: Machine A cannot connect to the Webserver on Machine C due to its firewall only allowing outbound traffic on TCP port 53.

Victim's machine Attacker's Machine Web server hosting files
	•	
Machine A <----------------> Machine B <---------------------------------------------> Machine C

Machine A <-------------------> w.y.x.z <-------------------------------------------------> a.b.c.d:80


Machine B sets up rinetd to forward all traffic incoming on port 53 to the web server on Machine C (a.b.c.d port 80): # w.x.y.z 53 a.b.c.d 80

Machine A connects to Machine B on port 53, which sends it's traffic on to the Webserver on Machine C: http://w.x.y.z:53
